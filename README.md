In Java, an array is a simple box with a set number of slots, where each slot holds something of the same type, like numbers or words. You know exactly how many slots there are, and you can quickly grab anything from a specific slot by its position. However, you can’t add more slots once the box is full—you’re stuck with the number you started with.
On the other hand, an ArrayList is like a stretchy bag that can hold as many items as you want. You don’t have to know how many things you’ll put in it from the beginning because the bag will grow or shrink as needed. While it’s super convenient to add or remove items, it’s a bit slower than an array when you’re trying to find something specific because the bag has to manage its size and keep everything organized.  To me array lists seem to be a lot more functional but they both have there use cases.
